    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Netarus is working with ODUâ€™s Computer Science department to share data collected from its HoistCam platform.  
	   HoistCam collects aerial footage similar to a drone, but is mounted onto equipment such as a tower crane.</p>
	<h3>Goals & Requirements</h3>
	<p>The goal of this competition is to automate analysis and report generation of video for managers of construction sites.  
	   Currently GB of data are generated daily and stored, but a human has to watch the videos for analysis.  The reasons 
	   workers watch these videos (outlined below) need to be incorporated into a video analytics platform.  The Project must 
	   demonstrate the real world and useful data within a construction environment.</p>
	<h3>Timeline</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li><b>Kick-Off Meeting:</b> July 11, 2016 @ 9 AM</li>
	  <li><b>Work Period:</b> July 11 through August 5</li>
	  <li><b>Final Award:</b> August 12, 2016</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Rules & Assumptions/Dependencies</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>20GB of images will be supplied on a storage area network/server to analyze 
	      and produce useful data.</li>
	  <li>Project must demonstrate the real world and useful data within a
     	  construction environment.</li>
	  <li>Can use all resources available to the general public or within the university.</li>
	  <li>Acceptable computer systems - Open software without licensing restrictions &
	      Use of ODU computing resources only</li>
	</ul>
