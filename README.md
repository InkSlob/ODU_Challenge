Hosting MEAN Stack for ODU Challenge
This is used as a portal for a group of international students on the campus of ODU.  Netarus and WM Jordan have given data from construction
sites (video footage from cranes) for video analysis.  The students were broken into groups of four and are competing to make the best 
analysis for a prize.

This portal is based on a MEAN Stack and has served as the medium for me to learn AngularJS, MongoDB (NoSQL), Express, and Node.
